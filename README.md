# MiniDiff: A minimal reference implementation of automatic differentiation in Rust

Companion repo for [Automatic Differentiation: From Forward to Reverse in Small Steps](https://getcode.substack.com/p/automatic-differentiation-from-forward?r=1dboko&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)

MiniDiff implements both forward and reverse mode automatic differentiation, and so enables differentiable programming in Rust.

It is meant to explain how automatic differentiation works, not as a crate to be used - though someone sufficiently motivated could develop it.

The development is largely based on <https://simon.peytonjones.org/provably-correct/>
